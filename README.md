* **How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?** <br> Katipult’s Director Brock Murray highlights that "those serving the private capital markets have remained low-tech endeavours. Very few industries as large as the private capital markets have not kept up. Yet private capital markets have largely stayed as a handshake-style business. Spreadsheets and email are about as high-tech as it gets". Katipult's goal is to solve this issue. https://financialpost.com/sponsored/business-sponsored/canadas-best-kept-fintech-secret-katipult-revolutionizing-how-the-world-invests<br><br>

## Landscape
* **What domain of the financial industry is the company in?** <br> Katipult at its core is a FinTech SAAS (Software-as-a service) business "serving the private capital market space, and automating the process that connects investors to private deals end-to-end". https://www.katipult.com/insights/tsx-c-suite-at-the-open-interview-with-katipult-ceo-gord-breese <br>  Katipult was highlighted by the Canadian Regulatory Technology Association as the RegTech firm of the month in July 2022. https://www.canadianregtech.ca/firm-of-the-month.html <br> <br>
* **What have been the major innovations of this domain over the last 5–10 years?** <br> SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) has played an integral role in fueling the growth of fintech companies and the financial services sector since 2018.  Innovations in SaaS have fueled the growth trajectory of fianancial institutions in many ways:<br> **1.** By ensuring that customer  data are stored securely and providing regular updates about any changes in the regulatory landscape, SaaS platforms help startups to easily comply with the regulations as the service providers take care of all the necessary compliance requirements. <br> **2.** By helping to quickly get started with operations without worrying about procurement, installation, and maintenance of software, SaaS platforms help startups to reduce their time to market. <br> **3.** By investing heavily in the security of their systems and constantly monitoring the platform for any vulnerabilities, SaaS platforms provide greater security controls to clients. Service providers also have automated these same security controls to quickly identify and fix any security issues. <br>**4.** By offering greater scalability, SaaS enables startups to expand their customer base quickly and efficiently in the financial services sector, known to be subject to volatile business cycles due to factors like economic recession, interest rate changes, etc. <br>https://bfsi.eletsonline.com/how-are-saas-platforms-helping-in-the-overall-growth-of-the-fintech-industry/<br><br>
* **What are other major companies in this domain?** <br> Other FinTech SaaS companies providing soultions to the private equity market include: <br> **1.** Cloudera (Palo Alto, California, United States), which has raised a total of $1B in funding over 13 rounds. <br> **2.** Acuity Knowledge Partners <br> **3.** Backstop Solutions Group (Chicago, Illinois, United States), which has raised a total of $20M in funding over 1 round.<br><br>
## Results
* **What has been the business impact of this company so far?**<br> Katipult has gone into 20 different regulatory environments, demonstrating that its software is something that can be configured for any marketplace.  Flagship clients include the Qatar Development Bank, as well as four publicly traded companies -- one listed on the New York Stock Exchange. <br>https://financialpost.com/sponsored/business-sponsored/canadas-best-kept-fintech-secret-katipult-revolutionizing-how-the-world-invests <br> Recently in the Canadian market, "TSX Trust Company (“TSX Trust”), a subsidiary of TMX Group Limited, has selected Katipult’s SaaS platform to power its new digital deal management service designed to automate workflow for private placements and streamline the issuer and investor onboarding process". Similarly, Cormark Securities (one of the longest-serving investment firms in Canada with over 40 years of history with an impressive $90B+ of capital raised in the last decade alone) has chosen to "work with Katipult to streamline and digitize account openings, private placement subscriptions, and other compliance and internal functions within a fully integrated, secure, single platform".<br><br>
* **What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is Katipult performing based on these metrics?** <br> As a guide to measure success, one can use the a range of factors that RegTech analysts for RegTech100 () consider to make its selection of the world's top 100 RegTech companies. These include: <br> **1.** Industry significance of the problem being solved <br> **2.** Growth, in terms of capital raised, revenue, customer traction <br> **3.** Innovation of technology solutions offered <br> **4.** Potential cost savings, efficiency improvement, impact on the value chain, and/or revenue enhancements generated for clients. <br> https://fintech.global/regtech100/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/RegTech100-Summary-2021.pdf <br> Being a true performance metric, criterion number 2 (i.e., Growth, in terms of capital raised, revenue, customer traction) can be used to assess Katipult's position as follows: <br>- Katipult has raised a total of $2.3M in funding over 2 rounds. Their latest funding was raised on Jun 7, 2018 from a Post-IPO Debt round. Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balance as at March 31, 2022 was $2.1M. <br>- Katipult continues to increase its revenue -- from $378K booked in first quarter of 2021, it increased 15.3% to $436 in first quarter of 2022. <br>- However,  due mostly to the increased salaries, subcontractors, and benefits expenditures (as the it invests in key employees), Net loss and comprehensive loss increased to $710k in the fourth quarter of 2021. <br>https://www.katipult.com/press-releases/katipult-releases-2022-q1-results<br> Considering the above, Katipult is observed to invest heavily in its development (i.e., R&D), which is currently impacting its bottom line. However, these expeditures are also partially offset by an increase in subscription revenue. Katipult is also expanding its global presence in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. <br><br>
* **How is Katipult performing relative to competitors in the same domain?** <br> By criterion number 2 above, Katipult is seen to have plenty of room to grow in order to establish itself in the market. A good comparable is Backstop Solutions Group (Chicago, Illinois, United States), which has raised a total of $20M in funding over 1 round -- this is over 8 times the funding Katipult has received. Moreover, Backstop Solutions Group's estimated annual revenue is currently $33M per year.

## Additional Descriptive Material
Current Katipult CEO, Gord Breese, sat down for an interview with Berk Sumen, head of TSX company services for their “C-Suite at The Open” series. In an effort to highlight the “unique stories and perspectives of companies listed on Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX)”, the conversation touched on both Katipult’s business model as well as the future growth outlook. <br>

## Recommendations
* **If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)** <br> A Research Management System (RMS). <br><br> 
* **Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?** <br> Deploying a RMS might be an oportunity for Katipult to begin tapping into other asset-class investment markets. The system could serve as single platform for investment management teams to research multiple asset classes. <br><br>
* **What technologies would this additional product or service utilise?** <br> As with Katipults current soultions, a RMS would simply require software development (programming) of the platform with secured cloud-computing capability.
